# 🌍 Earthquake Prediction Model

A comprehensive system for predicting seismic activity using machine learning and geophysical data.

## 🎯 Project Goals
- Develop predictive models for seismic activity using geophysical data and ML
- Simulate tectonic plate movements and predict stress accumulation in fault zones  
- Identify and map high-risk regions for potential seismic events
- Provide insights for disaster preparedness, urban planning, and research
